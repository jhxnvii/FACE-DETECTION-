->The first step is to take the image and resize it to different scales in order to build an image pyramid, which is the input of the following three-staged cascaded network.
Proposal Network (P-Net): FCN is that a fully convolutional network
This Proposal Network is used to obtain candidate windows and their bounding box regression vectors.
Bounding box regression is a popular technique to predict the localization of boxes when the goal is detecting an object of some pre-defined class, in this case faces. 

-> Refine Network (R-Net): CNN
The R-Net outputs wether the input is a face or not, a 4 element vector which is the bounding box for the face, and a 10 element vector for facial landmark localization.

->Output Network (O-Net):
Output Network aims to describe the face in more detail and output the five facial landmarks’ positions for eyes, nose and mouth.

Three Tasks of MTCNN
The Network’s task is to output three things: face/non-face classification, bounding box regression, and facial landmark localization.
